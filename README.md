## Wyn-Weather APP

This app was boostrapped with Create React App. We added react-router-dom, and configured a BrowserRouter in App.js that has two Routes: `CitySearch` and `SingleCity`.

The rest is up to you, but you will want to use the two API endpoints we've already built:

### City Search API Endpoint (GET)

- `https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities`
- Takes one GET parameter named `query`
- https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities?query=lo

### City Forecast API Endpoint (GET)

- `https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities/:id`
- `:id` is an city ID
- Example: https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities/44418

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo and `cd` into it
- `yarn install && yarn start`

## Objective

See how far you can get in building something like this: https://wyn-weather-app.herokuapp.com/

## Details

Using `https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities?query=ma`, try to populate a list of cities like this:

And using `https://wyn-weather-api.herokuapp.com/cities/766273`, try to display the city's name and a set of upcoming daily forecasts.

## Instructions

- Clone this repo, cd into it, yarn install and yarn start
- Make an issue, check out a branch that has your name in it and references your issue number
- Check out App.js: you already have `BrowserRouter` and two routes that point to existing components. **You will be building the App in the two components.** ðŸ˜ƒ
- In CitySearch, create a list of `cities` with the useState hook, which should default to an empty array.
- Create a function called `handleSearch` that will call your API and set the list of cities with state.
- You will need to render the results in this component -- try doing this with an input that will trigger `handleSearch` on submit and map through the results as a list.
- The list items should have links that point to the `SingleCity` route and component.
- Inside `SingleCity`, you will need to set a default city inside of state. The default city might, for example, have default values for the `name` and `forecasts` values. `name` would be a string and `forecasts` an array, so try setting this state to an empty object.
- Make an API call via useEffect that will update the value of the city with state.
- You should then render the results to display the upcoming daily forecasts.
- You should place a link on this page to go back to all cities.

## Submitting

- No matter how far you get, commit your work, push it up, and submit a pull request before the 60 minute time limit expires.

## Bonus

Bonus points for formatting the dates nicely (hint: moment.js), or for allowing the user to change the temps from C to F and back (hint: F = 1.8 \* C + 32).

All of this is just a starting point. Keep working on this throughout the week for additional React practice!
